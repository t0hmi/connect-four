# Connect Four in Angular

This project is a fun side project that allows users to play the classic game of Connect Four against an opponent.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your machine. Once you have these prerequisites, you can clone the repository and run the following commands:


```bash
npm install
ng serve
```


This will install all the necessary dependencies and start a development server on http://localhost:4200/. You can then access the game by navigating to that URL in your browser.
How to Play

The game is simple to play. Players take turns dropping colored disks into a vertical grid with the goal of getting four disks of their color in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Each player is assigned a color (red or yellow) and will take turns dropping their disks into the grid. The disk will fall to the bottom-most available space in the column. The game ends when one player gets four disks in a row or the grid is full with no winner.
